# Coffee-Maker
Group project under Lamar's CSNHS club. This is the code for an automatic coffee machine that can respond to SMS orders. A simple menu can be accessed that dictates
the amount of milk, creamer, and coffee to add to make drinks for students passing by the computer lab. To order: text "robobarista@outlook.com", which will check if 
a valid order was sent through, then pour the proper drink.

TODO: Link the album of images of constructing the coffee machine & of the final product
